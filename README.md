## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Building Energy Benchmarking data from 2016 to better understand:

1. Which Types of Buildings Use More Energy?
2. Which Types of Buildings Contribute Most to Greenhouse Gas Emissions?
3. How Do the Different Buildings Relate to Greenhouse Gas Emissions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here (Building_Energy_Benchmarking) to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://mona-hatamiai.medium.com/how-does-your-building-energy-use-compare-with-other-buildings-1049f9ee5ec2).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Seatlle Office of Sustainability & Environmentfor the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
